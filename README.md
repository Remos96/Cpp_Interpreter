# Cpp_Translator
A simple language can be read and translated to C++ instructions that also provides which line an error was found on!

The case-sensitive language must follow these rules:
  - Only a single instruction per line (blanks line are valid).
  - Comments are indicated via '#'.
  - Handle addition, subtraction, and multiplication only.
  - Only contains two variables types, strings and integers that are represented with the types of NUMBER and STRING.
  - PRINT is used for printing (cannot handle arithmetic inside of print).
